# hart-solitare
Basic command line implementation of a variant of solitaire.
My family has a version of solitaire that has a different set of rules.
It's dealt as normal, and you can move any stack of cards to any other, as long as the last card in the previous pile is the the same suit, and one value higher than the card moved onto it.

Only kings can be moved to empty columns.
